                The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses
                nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in
                memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the
                mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were
                added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic
                inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its
                construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other
                artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran.
                Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.
                <br><br>The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of
                Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and
                voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic
                aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the
                monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi
                precious stones make it a monument apart.
                <br><br>The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical plannedbuilding, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry
                along a central axis on which the main features are
                placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and
                inlay work of precious/semi precious stones. The mosque and the guest house in the Taj Mahal complex are
                built of red sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large
                platform over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical
                structures.
