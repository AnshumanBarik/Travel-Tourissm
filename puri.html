                with the temple. Here are some interesting facts about Rath Yatra, Jagannath Puri history, and much
                more.

                <br><br>
                The Jagannath Puri temple is an Odisha temple located in Puri, which is about 69 kilometers from
                Bhubaneshwar, the capital of Odisha. The temple is a very ancient and sacred place of pilgrimage for
                Hindus. It is best known for its world-famous Rath Yatra which is the largest festival of its kind in
                the world. Rath Yatra is not something specific to The Jagannath Puri Temple.

                It is a feature of many temples across India. In the state of Odisha itself, Rath Yatra’s are held in
                Konark in honor of the Sun God and in Bhubaneshwar at the Lingraj temple in honor of Lord Lingraj.

                <br><br>The Rath Yatra is one of the most spectacular as well as ancient events in the world. It is an
                annual event watched by millions. It is a grand testimony to the faith and devotion of millions to the
                temple and its deity. The Puri Jagannath temple and the Rath Yatra are eternal and an integral part of
                the cultural and religious ethos of India.

                Just like the Somnath temple and many other temples in India, the Jagannath Puri temple stands as a
                defiant structure that defines the resilience of India and its culture.

                We look at some of the untold stories of Rath Yatra and many amazing facts about the Rath Yatra and its
                origins. It is difficult to separate fact from myth and legend, but nonetheless, they all add to the
                aura of mystery and intrigue that is associated with the Jagannath Puri temple story and the Rath Yatra.
